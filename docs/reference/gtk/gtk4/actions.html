    <p>This chapter describes in detail how <span class="caps">GTK</span> uses actions to connect
activatable <span class="caps">UI</span> elements to callbacks. <span class="caps">GTK</span> inherits the underlying
architecture of <code>GAction</code> and <code>GMenu</code> for describing abstract actions
and menus from the <span class="caps">GIO</span>&nbsp;library.</p>
<h2 id="basics-about-actions">Basics about actions<a class="md-anchor" href="#basics-about-actions" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>A <code>GAction</code> is essentially a way to tell the toolkit about a piece of
functionality in your program, and to give it a&nbsp;name.</p>
<p>Actions are purely functional. They do not contain any presentational&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>An action has four pieces of information associated with&nbsp;it:</p>
<ul>
<li>a name as an identifier (usually all-lowercase, untranslated
  English&nbsp;string)</li>
<li>an enabled flag indicating if the action can be activated or not
  (like the &#8220;sensitive&#8221; property on&nbsp;widgets)</li>
<li>an optional state value, for stateful actions (like a boolean for&nbsp;toggles)</li>
<li>an optional parameter type, used when activating the&nbsp;action</li>
</ul>
<p>An action supports two operations. You can activate it, which requires
passing a parameter of the correct type And you can request to change
the actions state (for stateful actions) to a new state value of the
correct&nbsp;type.</p>
<p>Here are some rules about an&nbsp;action:</p>
<ul>
<li>the name is immutable (in the sense that it will never change) and
  it is never <code>NULL</code></li>
<li>the enabled flag can&nbsp;change</li>
<li>the parameter type is&nbsp;immutable</li>
<li>the parameter type is optional: it can be <code>NULL</code></li>
<li>if the parameter type is <code>NULL</code> then action activation must be done
  without a parameter (ie: a <code>NULL</code> GVariant&nbsp;pointer)</li>
<li>if the parameter type is non-<code>NULL</code> then the parameter must have this&nbsp;type</li>
<li>the state can change, but it cannot change&nbsp;type</li>
<li>if the action was stateful when it was created, it will always have a
  state and it will always have exactly the same type (such as boolean
  or&nbsp;string)</li>
<li>if the action was stateless when it was created, it can never have a&nbsp;state</li>
<li>you can only request state changes on stateful actions and it is only
  possible to request that the state change to a value of the same type
  as the existing&nbsp;state</li>
</ul>
<p>An action does not have any sort of presentational information such as
a label, an icon or a way of creating a widget from&nbsp;it.</p>
<h2 id="action-state-and-parameters">Action state and parameters<a class="md-anchor" href="#action-state-and-parameters" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>Most actions in your application will be stateless actions with no
parameters. These typically appear as menu items with no special
decoration. An example is&nbsp;&#8220;quit&#8221;.</p>
<p>Stateful actions are used to represent an action which has a
closely-associated state of some kind. A good example is a &#8220;fullscreen&#8221;
action. For this case, you would expect to see a checkmark next to the
menu item when the fullscreen option is active. This is usually called
a toggle action, and it has a boolean state. By convention, toggle actions
have no parameter type for activation: activating the action always toggles
the&nbsp;state.</p>
<p>Another common case is to have an action representing a enumeration of
possible values of a given type (typically string). This is often called
a radio action and is usually represented in the user interface with radio
buttons or radio menu items, or sometimes a combobox. A good example is
&#8220;text-justify&#8221; with possible values &#8220;left&#8221;, &#8220;center&#8221;, and &#8220;right&#8221;. By
convention, these types of actions have a parameter type equal to their
state type, and activating them with a particular parameter value is
equivalent to changing their state to that&nbsp;value.</p>
<p>This approach to handling radio buttons is different than many other
action systems such as <code>GtkAction</code>. With <code>GAction</code>, there is only one action
for &#8220;text-justify&#8221; and &#8220;left&#8221;, &#8220;center&#8221; and &#8220;right&#8221; are possible states on
that action. There are not three separate &#8220;justify-left&#8221;, &#8220;justify-center&#8221;
and &#8220;justify-right&#8221;&nbsp;actions.</p>
<p>The final common type of action is a stateless action with a parameter.
This is typically used for actions like &#8220;open-bookmark&#8221; where the parameter
to the action would be the identifier of the bookmark to&nbsp;open.</p>
<p>Because some types of actions cannot be invoked without a parameter, it is
often important to specify a parameter when referring to the action from
a place where it will be invoked (such as from a radio button that sets
the state to a particular value or from a menu item that opens a specific
bookmark). In these contexts, the value used for the action parameter is
typically called the target of the&nbsp;action.</p>
<p>Even though toggle actions have a state, they do not have a parameter.
Therefore, a target value is not needed when referring to them — they
will always be toggled on&nbsp;activation.</p>
<p>Most APIs that allow using a <code>GAction</code> (such as <code>GMenuModel</code> and <code>GtkActionable</code>)
allow use of detailed action names. This is a convenient way of specifying
an action name and an action target with a single&nbsp;string.</p>
<p>In the case that the action target is a string with no unusual characters
(ie: only alphanumeric, plus &#8216;-&#8216; and &#8216;.&#8217;) then you can use a detailed
action name of the form &#8220;justify::left&#8221; to specify the justify action with
a target of&nbsp;left.</p>
<p>In the case that the action target is not a string, or contains unusual
characters, you can use the more general format &#8220;action-name(5)&#8221;, where the
&#8220;5&#8221; here is any valid text-format GVariant (ie: a string that can be parsed
by g_variant_parse()). Another example is&nbsp;&#8220;open-bookmark(&#8216;http://gnome.org/&#8217;)&#8221;.</p>
<p>You can convert between detailed action names and split-out action names
and target values using g_action_parse_detailed_name() and
g_action_print_detailed_name() but usually you will not need to. Most APIs
will provide both ways of specifying actions with&nbsp;targets.</p>
<h2 id="action-scopes">Action scopes<a class="md-anchor" href="#action-scopes" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>Actions are always scoped to a particular object on which they&nbsp;operate.</p>
<p>In <span class="caps">GTK</span>, actions are typically scoped to either an application or a window,
but any widget can have actions associated with&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Actions scoped to windows should be the actions that specifically impact
that window. These are actions like &#8220;fullscreen&#8221; and &#8220;close&#8221;, or in the
case that a window contains a document, &#8220;save&#8221; and&nbsp;&#8220;print&#8221;.</p>
<p>Actions that impact the application as a whole rather than one specific
window are scoped to the application. These are actions like &#8220;about&#8221; and&nbsp;&#8220;preferences&#8221;.</p>
<p>If a particular action is scoped to a window then it is scoped to a
specific window. Another way of saying this: if your application has a
&#8220;fullscreen&#8221; action that applies to windows and it has three windows,
then it will have three fullscreen actions: one for each&nbsp;window.</p>
<p>Having a separate action per-window allows for each window to have a
separate state for each instance of the action as well as being able to
control the enabled state of the action on a per-window&nbsp;basis.</p>
<p>Actions are added to their relevant scope (application, window or widget)
either using the <code>GActionMap</code> interface, or by using
gtk_widget_insert_action_group(). Actions that will be the same for all
instances of a widget class can be added globally using&nbsp;gtk_widget_class_install_action().</p>
<h2 id="action-groups-and-action-maps">Action groups and action maps<a class="md-anchor" href="#action-groups-and-action-maps" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>Actions rarely occurs in isolation. It is common to have groups
of related actions, which are represented by instances of the
<code>GActionGroup</code> interface.</p>
<p>Action maps are a variant of action groups that allow to change
the name of the action as it is looked up. In <span class="caps">GTK</span>, the convention
is to add a prefix to the action name to indicate the scope of
the actions, such as &#8220;app.&#8221; for the actions with application scope
or &#8220;win.&#8221; for those with window&nbsp;scope.</p>
<p>When referring to actions on a GActionMap only the name of the
action itself is used (ie: &#8220;quit&#8221;, not &#8220;app.quit&#8221;). The
&#8220;app.quit&#8221; form is only used when referring to actions from
places like a <code>GMenu</code> or <code>GtkActionable</code> widget where the scope
of the action is not already&nbsp;known.</p>
<p><code>GtkApplication</code> and <code>GtkApplicationWindow</code> implement the <code>GActionMap</code>
interface, so you can just add actions directly to them. For
other widgets, use gtk_widget_insert_action_group() to add
actions to&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>If you want to insert several actions at the same time, it is
typically faster and easier to use <code>GActionEntry</code>.</p>
<h2 id="connecting-actions-to-widgets">Connecting actions to widgets<a class="md-anchor" href="#connecting-actions-to-widgets" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>Any widget that implements the <code>GtkActionable</code> interface can
be connected to an action just by setting the ::action-name
property. If the action has a parameter, you will also need
to set the ::action-target property. Widgets that implement
<code>GtkActionable</code> include <code>GtkSwitch</code>, <code>GtkButton</code>, and their
respective&nbsp;subclasses.</p>
<p>Another way of obtaining widgets that are connected to actions
is to create a menu using a <code>GMenu</code> menu model. <code>GMenu</code> provides an
abstract way to describe typical menus: nested groups of items
where each item can have a label, and icon, and an&nbsp;action.</p>
<p>A typical use of <code>GMenu</code> inside <span class="caps">GTK</span> is to set up an application
menubar with gtk_application_set_menubar(). Another, maybe more
common use is to create a popover for a menubutton, using&nbsp;gtk_menu_button_set_menu_model().</p>
<p>Unlike traditional menus, those created from menu models don&#8217;t
have keyboard accelerators associated with menu items. Instead,
<code>GtkApplication</code> offers the gtk_application_set_accels_for_action()
<span class="caps">API</span> to associate keyboard shortcuts with&nbsp;actions.</p>
<h2 id="activation">Activation<a class="md-anchor" href="#activation" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>When a widget with a connected action is activated, <span class="caps">GTK</span> finds
the action to activate by walking up the widget hierarchy,
looking for a matching action, ending up at the <code>GtkApplication</code>.</p>
<h2 id="built-in-actions">Built-in Actions<a class="md-anchor" href="#built-in-actions" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p><span class="caps">GTK</span> uses actions for its own purposes in a number places. These
built-in actions can sometimes be activated by applications, and
you should avoid naming conflicts with them when creating your
own&nbsp;actions.</p>
