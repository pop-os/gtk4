    <h2 id="building-gtk">Building GTK<a class="md-anchor" href="#building-gtk" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>Before we get into the details of how to compile <span class="caps">GTK</span>, we should
mention that in many cases, binary packages of <span class="caps">GTK</span> prebuilt for
your operating system will be available, either from your
operating system vendor or from independent sources. If such a
set of packages is available, installing it will get you
programming with <span class="caps">GTK</span> much faster than building it yourself. In
fact, you may well already have <span class="caps">GTK</span> installed on your system&nbsp;already.</p>
<p>In order to build <span class="caps">GTK</span>, you will need <em>meson</em> installed on your
system. On Linux, and other <span class="caps">UNIX</span>-like operating systems, you will
also need <em>ninja</em>. This guide does not cover how to install these
two requirements, but you can refer to the
<a href="http://mesonbuild.com">Meson website</a> for more information. The
<a href="https://ninja-build.org">Ninja</a> build tool is also usable on
various operating systems, so we will refer to it in the&nbsp;examples.</p>
<p>If you are building <span class="caps">GTK</span> from a source distribution or from a Git
clone, you will need to use <em>meson</em> to configure the project. The
most commonly useful argument is the <code>--prefix</code> one, which determines
where the files will go once installed. To install <span class="caps">GTK</span> under a prefix
like <code>/opt/gtk</code> you would run Meson&nbsp;as:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>meson setup --prefix /opt/gtk builddir
</code></pre></div>

<p>Meson will create the <code>builddir</code> directory and place all the build
artefacts&nbsp;there.</p>
<p>You can get a list of all available options for the build by
running <code>meson configure</code>.</p>
<p>After Meson successfully configured the build directory, you then
can run the build, using&nbsp;Ninja:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>cd builddir
ninja
ninja install
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you don&#8217;t have permission to write to the directory you are
installing in, you may have to change to root temporarily before
running <code>ninja install</code>.</p>
<p>Several environment variables are useful to pass to set before
running <em>meson</em>. <code>CPPFLAGS</code> contains options to pass to the C
compiler, and is used to tell the compiler where to look for
include files. The <code>LDFLAGS</code> variable is used in a similar fashion
for the linker. Finally the <code>PKG_CONFIG_PATH</code> environment variable
contains a search path that <code>pkg-config</code> (see below) uses when
looking for files describing how to compile programs using different
libraries. If you were installing <span class="caps">GTK</span> and it&#8217;s dependencies into
<code>/opt/gtk</code>, you might want to set these variables&nbsp;as:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>CPPFLAGS=&quot;-I/opt/gtk/include&quot;
LDFLAGS=&quot;-L/opt/gtk/lib&quot;
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=&quot;/opt/gtk/lib/pkgconfig&quot;
export CPPFLAGS LDFLAGS PKG_CONFIG_PATH
</code></pre></div>

<p>You may also need to set the <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variable
so the systems dynamic linker can find the newly installed libraries,
and the <code>PATH</code> environment program so that utility binaries installed
by the various libraries will be&nbsp;found.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH=&quot;/opt/gtk/lib&quot;
PATH=&quot;/opt/gtk/bin:$PATH&quot;
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH PATH
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="build-types">Build types<a class="md-anchor" href="#build-types" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>Meson has different build types, exposed by the <code>buildtype</code>
configuration option. <span class="caps">GTK</span> enables and disables functionality
depending on the build type used when calling <em>meson</em> to
configure the&nbsp;build.</p>
<h3 id="debug-builds">Debug builds<a class="md-anchor" href="#debug-builds" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p><span class="caps">GTK</span> will enable debugging code paths in both the <code>debug</code> and
<code>debugoptimized</code> build types. Builds with <code>buildtype</code> set to
<code>debug</code> will additionally enable consistency checks on the
internal state of the&nbsp;toolkit.</p>
<p>It is recommended to use the <code>debug</code> or <code>debugoptimized</code> build
types when developing <span class="caps">GTK</span> itself. Additionally, <code>debug</code> builds of
<span class="caps">GTK</span> are recommended for profiling and debugging <span class="caps">GTK</span> applications,
as they include additional validation of the internal&nbsp;state.</p>
<p>The <code>debugoptimized</code> build type is the default for <span class="caps">GTK</span> if no build
type is specified when calling <em>meson</em>.</p>
<h3 id="release-builds">Release builds<a class="md-anchor" href="#release-builds" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>The <code>release</code> build type will disable debugging code paths and
additional run time safeties, like checked casts for object&nbsp;instances.</p>
<p>The <code>plain</code> build type provided by Meson should only be used when
packaging <span class="caps">GTK</span>, and it&#8217;s expected that packagers will provide their
own compiler flags when building <span class="caps">GTK</span>. See the previous section for
the list of environment variables to be used to define compiler and
linker flags. Note that with the plain build type, you are also
responsible for controlling the debugging features of <span class="caps">GTK</span> with
<code>-DG_ENABLE_DEBUG</code> and <code>-DG_DISABLE_CAST_CHECKS</code>.</p>
<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies<a class="md-anchor" href="#dependencies" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>Before you can compile the <span class="caps">GTK</span> widget toolkit, you need to have
various other tools and libraries installed on your
system. Dependencies of <span class="caps">GTK</span> have their own build systems, so
you will need to refer to their own installation&nbsp;instructions.</p>
<p>A particular important tool used by <span class="caps">GTK</span> to find its dependencies
is <code>pkg-config</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/">pkg-config</a>
is a tool for tracking the compilation flags needed for libraries
that are used by the <span class="caps">GTK</span> libraries. (For each library, a small <code>.pc</code>
text file is installed in a standard location that contains the
compilation flags needed for that library along with version number&nbsp;information.)</p>
<p>Some of the libraries that <span class="caps">GTK</span> depends on are maintained by the
<span class="caps">GTK</span> team: GLib, GdkPixbuf, Pango, and GObject Introspection.
Other libraries are maintained&nbsp;separately.</p>
<ul>
<li>The GLib library provides core non-graphical functionality
  such as high level data types, Unicode manipulation, and
  an object and type system to C programs. It is available
  from <a href="https://download.gnome.org/sources/glib/">here</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://git.gnome.org/browse/gdk-pixbuf/">GdkPixbuf</a>
  library provides facilities for loading images in a variety of
  file formats. It is available <a href="ttps://download.gnome.org/sources/gdk-pixbuf/">here</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.pango.org">Pango</a> is a library for internationalized
  text handling. It is available <a href="https://download.gnome.org/sources/pango/">here</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GObjectIntrospection">GObject Introspection</a>
  is a framework for making introspection data available to language
  bindings. It is available <a href="https://download.gnome.org/sources/gobject-introspection/">here</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/"><span class="caps">GNU</span> libiconv</a> library
  is needed to build GLib if your system doesn&#8217;t have the iconv()
  function for doing conversion between character encodings. Most
  modern systems should have&nbsp;iconv().</li>
<li>The libintl library from the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/"><span class="caps">GNU</span> gettext</a>
  package is needed if your system doesn&#8217;t have the gettext()
  functionality for handling message translation&nbsp;databases.</li>
<li>The libraries from the X window system are needed to build
  Pango and <span class="caps">GTK</span>. You should already have these installed on
  your system, but it&#8217;s possible that you&#8217;ll need to install
  the development environment for these libraries that your
  operating system vendor&nbsp;provides.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/fontconfig/">fontconfig</a>
  library provides Pango with a standard way of locating
  fonts and matching them against font&nbsp;names.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cairographics.org">Cairo</a> is a graphics library that
  supports vector graphics and image compositing. Both Pango and <span class="caps">GTK</span>
  use Cairo for drawing. Note that we also need the auxiliary cairo-gobject&nbsp;library.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/anholt/libepoxy">libepoxy</a> is a library that
  abstracts the differences between different OpenGL libraries. <span class="caps">GTK</span>
  uses it for cross-platform <span class="caps">GL</span> support and for its own&nbsp;drawing.</li>
<li><a href="http://ebassi.github.io/graphene/">Graphene</a> is a library that
  provides vector and matrix types for 2D and 3D transformations.
  <span class="caps">GTK</span> uses it internally for&nbsp;drawing.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org">Wayland</a> libraries are needed
  to build <span class="caps">GTK</span> with the Wayland&nbsp;backend.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/shared-mime-info">shared-mime-info</a>
  package is not a hard dependency of <span class="caps">GTK</span>, but it contains definitions
  for mime types that are used by <span class="caps">GIO</span> and, indirectly, by <span class="caps">GTK</span>.
  gdk-pixbuf will use <span class="caps">GIO</span> for mime type detection if possible.
  For this to work, shared-mime-info needs to be installed and
  <code>XDG_DATA_DIRS</code> set accordingly at configure time. Otherwise,
  gdk-pixbuf falls back to its built-in mime type&nbsp;detection.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="building-and-testing-gtk">Building and testing GTK<a class="md-anchor" href="#building-and-testing-gtk" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>First make sure that you have the necessary external
dependencies installed: <code>pkg-config</code>, Meson, Ninja,
the <span class="caps">JPEG</span>, <span class="caps">PNG</span>, and <span class="caps">TIFF</span> libraries, FreeType, and, if necessary,
libiconv and libintl. To get detailed information about building
these packages, see the documentation provided with the
individual packages. On any average Linux system, it&#8217;s quite likely
you&#8217;ll have all of these installed already, or they will be easily
accessible through your operating system package&nbsp;repositories.</p>
<p>Then build and install the <span class="caps">GTK</span> libraries in the order:
GLib, Cairo, Pango, then <span class="caps">GTK</span>. For each library, follow the
instructions they provide, and make sure to share common settings
between them and the <span class="caps">GTK</span> build; if you are using a separate prefix
for <span class="caps">GTK</span>, for instance, you will need to use the same prefix for
all its dependencies you build. If you&#8217;re lucky, this will all go
smoothly, and you&#8217;ll be ready to <a href="#gtk-compiling">start compiling your own <span class="caps">GTK</span>
applications</a>. You can test your <span class="caps">GTK</span> installation
by running the <code>gtk4-demo</code> program that <span class="caps">GTK</span>&nbsp;installs.</p>
<p>If one of the projects you&#8217;re configuring or building fails, look
closely at the error messages printed; these will often provide useful
information as to what went wrong. Every build system has its own
log that can help you understand the issue you&#8217;re encountering. If
all else fails, you can ask for help on the
<a href="#gtk-resources"><span class="caps">GTK</span> forums</a>.</p>
<h2 id="extra-configuration-options">Extra Configuration Options<a class="md-anchor" href="#extra-configuration-options" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>In addition to the normal options provided by Meson, <span class="caps">GTK</span> defines various
arguments that modify what should be built. All of these options are passed
to <code>meson</code> as <code>-Doption=value</code>. Most of the time, the value can be <code>true</code> or
<code>false</code>, or <code>enabled</code>, <code>disabled</code> or <code>auto</code>.</p>
<p>To see a summary of all supported options and their allowed values,&nbsp;run</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>meson configure builddir
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="x11-backend-win32-backend-broadway-backend-wayland-backend-and-macos-backend"><code>x11-backend</code>, <code>win32-backend</code>, <code>broadway-backend</code>, <code>wayland-backend</code> and <code>macos-backend</code><a class="md-anchor" href="#x11-backend-win32-backend-broadway-backend-wayland-backend-and-macos-backend" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Enable specific backends for <span class="caps">GDK</span>.  If none of these options
are given, the Wayland backend will be enabled by default,
if the platform is Linux; the X11 backend will also be enabled
by default, unless the platform is Windows, in which case the
default is win32, or the platform is macOS, in which case the
default is macOS. If any backend is explicitly enabled or disabled,
no other platform will be enabled&nbsp;automatically.</p>
<h3 id="vulkan"><code>vulkan</code><a class="md-anchor" href="#vulkan" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>By default, <span class="caps">GTK</span> will try to build with support for the Vulkan graphics
<span class="caps">API</span> in addition to cairo and OpenGL. This option can be used to explicitly
control whether Vulkan should be&nbsp;used.</p>
<h3 id="xinerama"><code>xinerama</code><a class="md-anchor" href="#xinerama" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>By default, <span class="caps">GTK</span> will try to link against the Xinerama libraries
if they are found. This option can be used to explicitly control
whether Xinerama should be&nbsp;used.</p>
<h3 id="media"><code>media</code><a class="md-anchor" href="#media" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>By default, <span class="caps">GTK</span> will try to build the gstreamer backend for
media playback support. This option can be used to explicitly
control which media backends should be&nbsp;built.</p>
<h3 id="print"><code>print</code><a class="md-anchor" href="#print" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>By default, <span class="caps">GTK</span> will try to build various print backends
if their dependencies are found. This option can be used
to explicitly control which print backends should be&nbsp;built.</p>
<h3 id="cloudproviders"><code>cloudproviders</code><a class="md-anchor" href="#cloudproviders" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>This option controls whether <span class="caps">GTK</span> should use libcloudproviders for
supporting various Cloud storage APIs in the file&nbsp;chooser.</p>
<h3 id="sysprof"><code>sysprof</code><a class="md-anchor" href="#sysprof" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>This option controls whether <span class="caps">GTK</span> should include support for
tracing with&nbsp;sysprof.</p>
<h3 id="tracker"><code>tracker</code><a class="md-anchor" href="#tracker" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>This option controls whether <span class="caps">GTK</span> should use Tracker for search
support in the file&nbsp;chooser.</p>
<h3 id="colord"><code>colord</code><a class="md-anchor" href="#colord" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>This option controls whether <span class="caps">GTK</span> should use colord for color
calibration support in the cups print&nbsp;backend.</p>
<h3 id="gtk_doc-and-man-pages"><code>gtk_doc</code> and <code>man-pages</code><a class="md-anchor" href="#gtk_doc-and-man-pages" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>The <em>gtk-doc</em> package is used to generate the reference documentation
included with <span class="caps">GTK</span>. By default support for <em>gtk-doc</em> is disabled
because it requires various extra dependencies to be installed.
If you have <em>gtk-doc</em> and <em>pandoc</em> installed and are modifying <span class="caps">GTK</span>,
you may want to enable <em>gtk-doc</em> support by passing in <code>-Dgtk_doc=true</code>.</p>
<p>Additionally, some tools provided by <span class="caps">GTK</span> have their own
manual pages generated using a similar set of dependencies;
if you have <em>xsltproc</em> then you can generate manual pages by
passing <code>-Dman-pages=true</code> when configuring the&nbsp;build.</p>
<h3 id="introspection"><code>introspection</code><a class="md-anchor" href="#introspection" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Allows to disable building introspection support. This is option
is mainly useful for shortening turnaround times on developer
systems. Installed builds of <span class="caps">GTK</span> should always have introspection&nbsp;support.</p>
<h3 id="build-tests-install-tests-demos"><code>build-tests</code>, <code>install-tests</code>, <code>demos</code><a class="md-anchor" href="#build-tests-install-tests-demos" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>By default, <span class="caps">GTK</span> will build quite a few tests and demos.
While these are useful on a developer system, they are not
needed when <span class="caps">GTK</span> is built e.g. for a flatpak runtime. These
options allow to disable building tests and&nbsp;demos.</p>
