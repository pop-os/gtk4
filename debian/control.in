#Description: icon theme caching utility
# gtk-update-icon-cache creates mmap()able cache files for icon themes.
# .
# GTK can use the cache files created by gtk-update-icon-cache to avoid a lot
# of system call and disk seek overhead when the application starts. Since the
# format of the cache files allows them to be mmap()ed shared between multiple
# applications, the overall memory consumption is reduced as well.
